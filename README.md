# Recommendation-System
This project implements a Recommendation System that suggests relevant items to users based on their preferences and past interactions. It explores multiple approaches including Content-Based Filtering, Collaborative Filtering (User-User &amp; Item-Item), and Hybrid Models, making it flexible for various domains such as movies, e-commerce, or music.
